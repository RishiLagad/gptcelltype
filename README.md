## GPT-Celltype Analysis Using Seurat

### Overview
This project utilizes the GPT-Celltype package integrated with Seurat to annotate cell types in single-cell RNA sequencing data. The analysis aims to provide detailed cell type classifications, enhancing the understanding of cellular diversity in complex biological samples.

### Data Source
The analysis is conducted on single-cell RNA-seq data. Details on the specific dataset can be added based on the confidentiality and availability of your data.

### Technologies Used
- **R Language**: For scripting and statistical computations.
- **Seurat**: Widely used in single-cell genomics for data analysis.
- **GPT-Celltype**: An advanced AI tool designed for accurate cell type annotation.

### Script Overview
- **Script Name**: `GPT_Celltype_Seurat_Analysis.R`
- This script includes all necessary steps to preprocess the RNA-seq data, integrate GPT-Celltype for cell annotation, and visualize the results using Seurat's powerful visualization tools.

### How to Run This Script
To replicate this analysis:
1. Ensure R is installed along with Seurat and GPT-Celltype packages.
2. Adjust the script to point to your dataset file path.
3. Execute the script to carry out the preprocessing, cell type annotation, and data visualization.

### Detailed Workflow
1. **Load Libraries**: Start by loading the required libraries (Seurat, GPT-Celltype).
2. **Data Preparation**: Read and convert your RNA-seq data into a Seurat object.
3. **Normalization and Feature Selection**: Normalize the data and identify variable features crucial for accurate cell type distinction.
4. **Integration with GPT-Celltype**: Apply the GPT-Celltype package to annotate the prepared Seurat object with predicted cell types.
5. **Visualization**: Use Seurat's visualization functions to plot annotated data, providing insights into the distribution and relation of various cell types within the sample.

### Example Visualization
Provide an example of the output visualization, such as a UMAP plot showing cell clusters with their annotated types:
